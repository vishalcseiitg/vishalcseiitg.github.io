<p>The exposure triangle is the most useful mental model in photography: three settings control how bright your photo is, and each one changes the “feel” of the image in a different way. Those three are <b>aperture</b>, <b>shutter speed</b>, and <b>ISO</b>. When you change one, you usually compensate with another to keep exposure balanced.</p>

<h3>1) Aperture (f/…): brightness + depth of field</h3>
<p>Aperture is the opening in your lens. A smaller f-number (like f/1.8) means a wider opening, letting in more light. It also gives a shallower depth of field — your subject pops while the background blurs. A larger f-number (like f/8 or f/11) lets in less light but keeps more of the scene in focus.</p>
<p><b>Quick use:</b> portraits often look great around f/1.8–f/2.8; street and everyday scenes often sit around f/4–f/8; landscapes commonly use f/8–f/11.</p>

<h3>2) Shutter speed: brightness + motion</h3>
<p>Shutter speed is how long the sensor is exposed to light. Faster shutter speeds (like 1/500) freeze motion but let in less light. Slower shutter speeds (like 1/30 or 1/5) gather more light but introduce motion blur or camera shake.</p>
<p><b>Quick use:</b> people walking: ~1/250; handheld general shots: try not to go below ~1/60; creative motion blur: 1/15 and slower (use stabilization or a tripod if possible).</p>

<h3>3) ISO: brightness + noise</h3>
<p>ISO is your sensor’s amplification. Higher ISO brightens the image but adds grain/noise and reduces clean detail. Lower ISO looks cleaner but needs more light (or a wider aperture / slower shutter).</p>
<p><b>Quick use:</b> keep ISO as low as you can; raise it only when aperture and shutter are already where you need them.</p>

<h3>How to choose settings in real life</h3>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Decide your priority (blurred background? frozen motion? cleanest image?).</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Set that parameter first.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Adjust the other two until your exposure looks right.</p>

<h3>Three ready-made recipes</h3>
<p><b>Portrait (soft background):</b> f/1.8–f/2.8, shutter ~1/200, ISO as needed.</p>
<p><b>Street (sharp + flexible):</b> f/4–f/8, shutter ~1/250, ISO auto (cap it if your camera allows).</p>
<p><b>Low light handheld:</b> open aperture as much as you can, keep shutter ~1/60 (or faster), raise ISO until exposure is correct.</p>

<p>Once you practice a bit, you’ll feel the triangle as a tradeoff: <i>aperture controls depth</i>, <i>shutter controls motion</i>, and <i>ISO controls cleanliness</i>. Master those three and you can handle almost any lighting situation.</p>
