<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<br>
<br>

<h4>
  I’m a PhD student at IIT Roorkee (Department of Computer Science & Engineering). Photography is my creative space — I’m learning, exploring, and sharing the moments and details that catch my eye.
</h4>

<br>

<h4>
  My work leans into light, geometry, and everyday scenes turned into simple visual stories.
</h4>

<br>

<h4>
  Collaborations, photo-walks, and creative projects are welcome.
